# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

A basic ML-based web app that recommends books based on user input.

As someone who loves to read books, I wanted to create something simple yet useful â€” a system that suggests what to read next based on your favorite books.

# ðŸ’¡ How It Works 

The model finds similar books using cosine similarity between book features (like title, author, or ratings).
You enter a book name â†’ it returns a list of similar books.
